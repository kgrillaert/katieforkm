I'll be presenting "Risks to Financial Inclusion by Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Counterterrorism Algorithms" at [IEEE ETHICS-2025](https://attend.ieee.org/ethics-2025/) on June 9th, 2025 at Northwestern University in Illinois. This paper was inspired by a prompt in the ["Finding Your Way in AI Ethics Consulting"](https://courses.babl.ai/p/finding-your-place-ai-ethics-consulting) course by Dr. Shea Brown of [BABL AI](https://www.https://babl.ai/). It is an excellent course, and I highly recommend checking out BABL AI.
