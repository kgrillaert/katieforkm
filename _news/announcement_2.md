On behalf of [ForHumanity](https://www.forhumanity.center), I will be attending the [in-person gathering](https://alltechishuman.org/all-tech-is-human-blog/all-tech-is-human-x-consulate-general-of-finland-new-york-to-hold-a-curated-gathering-on-may-21st-on-strengthening-multistakeholder-collaboration-in-responsible-ai) hosted by [All Tech Is Human](https://alltechishuman.org) and the Consulate General of Finland in New York. Looking forward to the expert panels and discussing AI governance and policy with an incredible group of people working in responsible AI.
