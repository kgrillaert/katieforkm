Katie Grillaert is a Wisconsinite, seven‑year Kettle Moraine resident, and elementary school parent running for School Board to strengthen school safety, responsible technology use, transparency, and academic excellence for every student. She is focused on protecting student safety and privacy, supporting strong core academics, and providing careful oversight of new technologies like AI so they serve learning, not replace it. Drawing on years of board and advisory experience—including service with the Twin Cities Obedience Training Club, the Minneapolis Animal Care and Control Advisory Board, and the [Secure and Responsible Technology Lab](https://www.sartlab.org)—Katie brings a proven track record of thoughtful governance, community engagement, and careful stewardship of complex, high‑impact issues. 

As an AI governance and cybersecurity professional and educator, she helps organizations navigate ethics, data privacy, bias, and complex regulations, and has taught or guest‑lectured at institutions such as Milwaukee School of Engineering, UW–Madison, and Carroll University. Katie is also a Fellow with [ForHumanity](https://www.forhumanity.dev), an international non‑profit that develops independent audit standards to reduce the risks of AI and automated systems, where she leads an AI Policy Accelerator that helps organizations turn emerging rules into practical, workable policies. 

Katie’s volunteer work has included a year of humanitarian technology consulting for social impact organizations, long‑term participation in family‑based service projects through Sunbeam Kids, and earlier initiatives like fostering dogs and running training and behavior programs for rescue animals—all grounded in the belief that community service is something children should see and practice alongside adults.

Through her work as Co‑Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of [Assessed Intelligence](https://www.assessedintelligence.com), Katie has helped leaders in highly regulated sectors strengthen cybersecurity, close AI risk and compliance gaps, and put clear policies in place—experience she believes can help Kettle Moraine make wise, practical decisions about technology, safety, and long‑term success.
