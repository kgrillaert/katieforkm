Katie Grillaert is a Wisconsinite, seven‑year Kettle Moraine resident, and elementary school parent running for School Board to __strengthen school safety, responsible technology use, transparency, and academic excellence for every student__. She is focused on protecting student safety and privacy, supporting strong core academics, and providing careful oversight of new technologies like AI so they serve learning, not replace it. Drawing on years of board and advisory experience—including service with the Twin Cities Obedience Training Club, the Minneapolis Animal Care and Control Advisory Board, and the [Secure and Responsible Technology Lab](https://www.sartlab.org)—Katie brings a proven track record of thoughtful governance, community engagement, and careful stewardship of complex, high‑impact issues. 

As an AI and cybersecurity governance professional and educator, she helps organizations navigate ethics, data privacy, bias, and complex regulations, and has taught or guest‑lectured at institutions such as Milwaukee School of Engineering, UW–Madison, and Carroll University. Katie is also a Fellow with [ForHumanity](https://www.forhumanity.dev), an international non‑profit that develops independent audit standards to reduce the risks of AI and automated systems, where she leads an AI Policy Accelerator that helps organizations turn emerging rules into practical, workable policies. 

Katie volunteers as a humanitarian technology consultant for social impact organizations and participates in family‑based service projects through [Sunbeam Kids](https://sunbeamkids.org/), where she can put into action her belief that community service is a critical skill—and something children should see and practice alongside adults.

Through her work as Co‑Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of [Assessed Intelligence](https://www.assessedintelligence.com), Katie has helped leaders in highly regulated sectors strengthen cybersecurity, close AI risk and compliance gaps, and put clear policies in place—experience she believes can help Kettle Moraine make wise, practical decisions about technology, safety, and long‑term success.



## Values
* __Listen and explain.__ Board decisions should be understandable and justifiable to the students, families, staff, and taxpayers they affect.

* __Duty of care.__ When a child is struggling or a safety concern is raised, the district has a responsibility to notice, respond, and follow through in partnership with families.

* __Students at the center.__ Schools exist to serve kids’ learning and growth, while being responsible stewards of community trust and taxpayer dollars.

## Platform 

I’m running for school board because I believe every decision should start with one question: *__Is this in the best interest of our kids?__* 

Kettle Moraine has a proud tradition of “learning without boundaries,” and I want to build on that. That means strong academics in reading, math, and critical thinking, and space for curiosity, creativity, and hands‑on learning. It also means teaching social‑emotional skills, good citizenship, and service, so our kids learn how to work with others, handle conflict, and contribute to their community.

I support responsible technology use that strengthens learning and prepares students for the real world. Technology should be used when it clearly improves instruction, while recognizing that strong relationships with teachers and peers are central to how students grow, learn, and build the problem‑solving and communication skills they will need as adults.

I am committed to reducing polarization in how we govern our schools. Discussions must be thoughtful and considerate, and decisions must be grounded in solid evidence, local data, and shared community values. I will keep the focus on one shared goal: academic excellence, real-world preparedness, and healthy, thriving kids in every school.
